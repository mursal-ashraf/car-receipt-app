# Car Receipt App

A simple app made using React, TypeScript and Mobx that allows a user to enter details of a car transaction - and generates a receipt from it. Receipt is based off the example one given on the VicRoads website.

Main motivation behind this was to delve into the world of Mobx - happened to be at a time where I was looking for a car as well :)

Note: I did not intend to use this for legal purposes - just a small little side project.
